#
# List of glob(7) patterns to match file names, a valid message digest
# (MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) of the packaged file or '*' to indicate all
# files should match, and whether or not it is allowed.
#
#
#<filename pattern>  <message digest>                           <allow/deny>
#
# Example:
#example.*           *                                          deny
#example.*           358922f032dc9f78d80baeb211beaab96cba1119   allow
#
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.  Columns need
# to be delimited by whitespace characters.  The third column needs to
# be the keyword 'allow' or 'deny'.  In most cases this file will have
# wildcard lines denying inclusion of all files that match the given
# pattern and then additional lines with the same pattern, a specific
# file digest, and then 'allow' to note that specific file is an
# exception to the wildcard rule.  The 'allow' or 'deny' keyword is
# case-insensitive.
